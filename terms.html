<h4>3. Delivery Time</h4>
<p>The vast majority of items are in stock for immediate delivery and we ship daily with GLS or other transporters but expect as a precaution a typical 3-5 days delivery.

<h4>6. Risk Of The Items</h4>
<p>The risk of the items purchased at Cheetah Shoes surpasses you as a consumer at the time of the delivery.</p>

<h4>7. Complaints</h4>
<p>When you shop at Cheetah Shoes you have 24 months of warranty. This means that you can either get the item repaired, exchanged, get your money back or refusal of the price, depending on the specific situation. It is of course a requirement that the complaint is justified and that the defect has not arisen as a result of an incorrect use of the product or other damaging behavior. You must complain within a "reasonable time" after you have discovered the defect of the item. If you complain within 4 weeks after the defect has been discovered, the complaint will always be timely. If you find an error, please contact Cheetah Shoes as soon as possible by mail or directly by phone. We will contact you for further information about returning the item. We will mail you a free return form or refund your (reasonable) shipping costs if the complaint is warranted. When you return the item, please provide a detailed description of what the problem is and a clear return address. Note! We do not receive packages sent per. Demand or anything similar. Keep in mind that the item must always be returned in proper packaging and receive a receipt for shipping so that we can refund your shipping costs. As a starting point you can only complain about errors that appear within two years after you have received the item. In this regard, it is important to save your invoice which serves as proof of your purchase and basis for both warranty and product warranty. Upon return of defective items, where the defect you specified cannot be found by Cheetah Shoes, the item will be returned to you incl. a survey fee which is calculated according to the price of the product. We charge a maximum of 500,- DKK in research fee.</p>

<h4>8. Responsibility</h4>
<p>It is not Cheetah Shoes' responsibility that the items ordered at the shop by the customer are the correct or properly ordered.

<p>As a private person, you have full right of return for 14 days from receipt of the item. This does not apply to companies. If you regret your purchase you will of course get the amount that you have paid back within 14 days from the date we received a message that you have regretted the deal. The refund is made using the same method of payment that you used to purchase, unless otherwise agreed. We can withhold payment until the item is returned and inspected. In case of an impairment that you are accountable for, this purchase price will be deducted. The rules of the buyer's deficiency may apply. The only cost you have when you regret is the postage to send the item back to us. When you return the item, please attach a copy of the invoice and the expedition will go faster. Note! We do not receive packages sent per. COD. You are required to return the items unused in original packaging and in the same condition and quantity as you received them. You must incur the costs associated with returning the items and you must send them as a package with tracking number as documentation for dispatch. If you have sent an item for withdrawal or complaint, you will always receive an e-mail when we have received the item. In the mail you will receive information about the further process of your withdrawal/complaint. Alternately you can undo your purchase by refusing to receive the item upon delivery. As a result of the new Consumer Agreement Act, which came into force 13/6-2014, you now have the opportunity to return products that have been used. If you choose to make use of this option, you will only receive a portion of the purchase price, depending on the merchant's commercial value.
